### TODO LIST

“How fast do certain paths converge toward selection readiness?” -> “Years from highest degree → selection” (chat gpt's idea)

eventually add support for every astronaut group.

Eventually support additionaly agencies ie. ESA ISRO JAXA

maybe some charts or diagrams for visual folks

### notes from chatgpt

#### on international agency data
```
A. Data collection (high leverage, high risk)
What you’re doing right
Focusing on groups, not individuals
Treating this as infrastructure, not insight

Risk
You can lose months here.
ESA / JAXA / ISRO data quality is inconsistent and culturally non-uniform.
```

#### on degree ratio
```
The MS holders are not “lighter candidates.”
They compensate with:
test pilot roles
military command
mission-critical engineering
extreme fieldwork
Insight you should surface
Degree level alone is not predictive; degree + responsibility density is.
```

#### on metric contexts
```
One more suggestion:
Add “why this stat exists”, not just “what it shows.”
Example:
“Advanced degrees are common → NASA favors long-horizon problem ownership.”
```

#### on UI
```
What’s worth doing early
Accessibility
Tables that sort/filter
Clear group boundaries
Click-throughs to primary sources
What to delay
“Space look and feel”
Heavy animation
Over-designed graphs
> A beautiful UI that implies certainty is worse than a plain UI that invites exploration.
```

#### dive into this later...
```
D. Gap-closing research (where you must be ruthless)
This is where most projects die.
Hard truth
You cannot do this exhaustively.
What is feasible
Pick one archetype per group:
civilian scientist
military pilot
medical professional
Then answer:
What kind of work closed the gap?
What responsibility threshold did they cross?
That’s enough to be useful without pretending to be comprehensive.

3. The constraint that will save the project
Here it is, plainly:
Never answer “what should I do?”
Only answer “what has historically counted.”
This keeps:
expectations realistic
scope bounded
credibility intact
It also future-proofs you against industry change.

4. Reframing your optional bonuses
Your “astronaut catalog” instinct is good, but I’d frame it as:
“Evidence trail”
Not a bio.
Not a profile.
A set of links that justify selection.
That’s aligned with everything you’ve built so far.
```



Data collection - Finish NASA Groups. Add ESA. Add JAXA, ISRO....etc -> this becomes a resource for any prospective astronaut in any country with a space program. 

UI enhancements - Pick better colors. Accessibility friendly. Tables and graphs to better illustrate trends-over-time. Add links to anything that can be linked (university names, astronaut wikipedia pages, etc). Icons in the Group table view to make it easier to glance and glean information. [FUTURE] maybe a "space look and feel"...etc. 

Stats with contexts - As you've emphasized, add disclaimers and supporting information so students don't view the data as an absolute source of truth. IE. "Masters degree recipients closed the gap by gaining a lot of hands on experience through the military or these special projects. learn more by clicking on the astronaut's name" etc 

Finally, the "Gap Closing" research. Actually sitting and comparing astronaut career experiences against the missions they were chosen for will take significant time. so, this will probably have to be rolled out group-by-group. but it will be quite useful, should anyone actually find the website.
