### TODO LIST

“How fast do certain paths converge toward selection readiness?” -> “Years from highest degree → selection” (chat gpt's idea)

eventually add support for every astronaut group.

Eventually support additionaly agencies ie. ESA ISRO JAXA

maybe some charts or diagrams for visual folks

### notes from chatgpt

#### on degree ratio
```
The MS holders are not “lighter candidates.”
They compensate with:
test pilot roles
military command
mission-critical engineering
extreme fieldwork
Insight you should surface
Degree level alone is not predictive; degree + responsibility density is.
```

#### on metric contexts
```
One more suggestion:
Add “why this stat exists”, not just “what it shows.”
Example:
“Advanced degrees are common → NASA favors long-horizon problem ownership.”
```

#### on UI
```
What’s worth doing early
Accessibility
Tables that sort/filter
Clear group boundaries
Click-throughs to primary sources
What to delay
“Space look and feel”
Heavy animation
Over-designed graphs
> A beautiful UI that implies certainty is worse than a plain UI that invites exploration.
```

D. Gap-closing research (where you must be ruthless)
This is where most projects die.
Hard truth
You cannot do this exhaustively.
What is feasible
Pick one archetype per group:
civilian scientist
military pilot
medical professional
Then answer:
What kind of work closed the gap?
What responsibility threshold did they cross?
That’s enough to be useful without pretending to be comprehensive.

3. The constraint that will save the project
Here it is, plainly:
Never answer “what should I do?”
Only answer “what has historically counted.”
This keeps:
expectations realistic
scope bounded
credibility intact
It also future-proofs you against industry change.

4. Reframing your optional bonuses
Your “astronaut catalog” instinct is good, but I’d frame it as:
“Evidence trail”
Not a bio.
Not a profile.
A set of links that justify selection.
That’s aligned with everything you’ve built so far.
