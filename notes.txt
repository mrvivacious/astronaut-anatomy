- notes -
 
group 23:
4:6 women:men
youngest is 33
oldest is 45. gap of 12 years!
Degree range from Masters to PHD.
4 have PHDs, and one MPH whatever that is
4 astronauts have military experience
No military branch is duplicated! Army is not present this time.
Only one has a middle name it seems
2 Stanford alum, 2 MIT, 2 Naval Postgrad school

takeaways:
For this specific cohort, no Bachelor degrees are present (prev: Bachelor degrees need not apply LOL)
a 33 year old can be paired with a 45 year old. is it due to differing responsibilities or did the 33 close the gap with significant experiences?
 (Age vs Responsibility Accumulation)
does military experience contribute? title attained, or actual responsiblities? can a student even utilize this information?
degree specializations could be valuable information as well.
